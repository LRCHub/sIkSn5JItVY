Love ain't a candle
It doesn't burn through one night
And need the dark to shine
Love is alive

And love ain't just a word
In every dictionary
But nowhere defined
Love is a man and he's mine

Love is alive and at our breakfast table
Everyday of the week
Love is alive and it grows everyday and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive

And here by me
Love ain't just a moon
A distant far away dream
That needs the night to rise

Love is alive
And love ain't just a song
Sweet words of music
To go dancin' by
Love is a man and he's mine

Oh, love is alive and at our breakfast table
Everyday of the week
Love is alive and it grows everyday and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me

Oh, love is alive and at our breakfast table
Everyday of the week
Love is alive and it grows everyday and night
Even in our sleep
Love is alive and it's made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive
And here by me

Love is alive, here by me
Love is alive, here by me
